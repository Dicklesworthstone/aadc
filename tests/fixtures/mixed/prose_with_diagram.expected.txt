# System Architecture

This document describes our system architecture.

## Overview

The system consists of three main components:

┌────────────────┐
│ API Gateway    │
│ Handles all    │
│ incoming reqs  │
└────────────────┘

The gateway routes requests to appropriate services.

## Data Flow

+--------+     +----------+
| Client|  →  | Server   |
+--------+     +----------+

This shows the basic request flow.

## Conclusion

The architecture is designed for scalability.
